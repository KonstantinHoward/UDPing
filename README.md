# UDPing

Ping is a built-in utility used for network diagnostic purposes. It uses [ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) and sits at the network layer. Its basic functionality is to "ping" a given device, specified by IP address, and return the roundtrip communication time. Relying on the network layer and sending pings synchronously can be a bottle-neck, particularly when pinging a large number of addresses (for example, all the devices in a small company's network). This console application implements the same functionality as ping, but uses sockets and UDP transport protocol to send and receive pings asynchronously, tremendously reducing the time necessary to send multiple pings to several addresses. The <code>pingserver</code> application sends pings, interacting with the user at the command line. <code>pingclient</code> runs on network devices and listens for pings from a <code>pingserver</code>. This project implements <code>pingclient</code> as a Windows Service to run in the background of a device when booted.
